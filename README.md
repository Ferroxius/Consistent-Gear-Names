# Consistent-Witcher-Gear-Names
In the base game and expansions I've noticed theres a bit of an inconsistency in the names of the various witcher gear. The cat and bear armour sets are referred to as Feline and Ursine (Which I've noted is a play on their latin family names) while the other sets are referred to by normal names

This mod aims to standardise this naming convention. Two versions exist:

### Normal Naming
Changes the Armour names to the following:
Feline     -> Cat
Ursine     -> Bear
Griffin
Wolf
Viper
Manticore

### Latin Family Names
Changes the Armour names to the following:
Feline
Ursine
Griffin     -> Gryphine
Wolf        -> Lupine
Viper       -> Serpentine
Manticore   -> Manticorine
